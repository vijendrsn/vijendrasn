## About the project
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in data analysis, helping us understand the structure, patterns, and characteristics of a dataset. In this example, we'll perform EDA on New York City taxi data using Python and various libraries. We'll visualize the data using countplots, distribution plots (displot), and histograms to gain insights.In which we performed Descriptive and Diagnostic Analysis.
We have used the NYC taxi dataset from Kaggle for this project -> https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nyc-taxi-trip-duration 

## Libraries Used:
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
